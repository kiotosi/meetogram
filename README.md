# üß± Tech stack
Server stack is simple:
- **Firebase** to sync data between users
- **Express** to use it for API
- **Joi** for check POST request fields
- **Jest** for unit-testing
- **Typescript** for type-definitions
- **Redis** (*Optional*) for managing data between calls instead of using Firebase

Client stack is also simple like a piece of cake:
- **Vue** for building UI
- **Typescript** for typing-definition
- **Vite** for fast build

All workspace is bootstraped via [Turbo](https://turbo.build/)üöÄ
